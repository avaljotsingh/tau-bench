If the keyboard comes with RGB backlighting and is full-sized, that\u2019s perfect. However, if there isn\u2019t a clicky, RGB, full-sized option available, I\u2019m fine with one that has no backlight as long as it\u2019s still full-sized and has clicky switches.\n\n2. Regarding the smart thermostat, I realized the one I received is compatible with Apple HomeKit, but I actually need one that works with Google Home instead. Could you help with that swap as well?\n\nPlease let me know if there\u2019s any further information you need from me to proceed. I\u2019d appreciate it if we could address everything in one go.
